ICS4U starter page

For my 20 time project, I shall be collaborating with Anees, Carter, and Cooper. Together we will make a twin stick shooter game. I specifically will be responsible for programming and balancing the player, and I will be creating and balancing items also.

My group and I collaborated again. We decided on the story of the game, what it should be titled, and the theme. My role was also switched, and now, I am responsible for creating a github pages website to host our game on, and re-colouring the game sprites.
